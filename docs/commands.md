## Overview

Upon successful installation, a set of nctl commands are available for execution from within a terminal session.  All such commands are prefixed by `nctl-` and allow you to perform tasks:

- create artefacts for an N-node network;
- start/stop individual nodes within the network;
- start/stop entire network;

## Managing network artefacts
